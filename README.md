# Ground penetrating radar full waveform inversion
This repository gives Multi-Region Full Waveform Inversion codes for Ground Penetrating Radar Common-offset Data.
﻿
**This repository reproduces the results of the paper "[Multi-Region Full Waveform Inversion for Ground Penetrating Radar Common-offset Data]" Geophysics.
﻿
# Overview
﻿
We propose an innovative multi-region full waveform inversion (MR-FWI) method for GPR common-offset data. This method optimizes the model grid division by dynamically adjusting the grid unit granularity of the underground medium division, thereby reducing the memory footprint in each inversion optimization process.
